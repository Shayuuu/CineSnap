🎬 **Excited to share my latest project: CineSnap - A Premium Movie Booking Platform!**

I've been working on building a full-stack movie ticket booking platform that combines cutting-edge technology with a seamless user experience. Here's what makes it special:

✨ **Key Features:**
• Real-time seat locking system using Redis (Upstash) to prevent double-booking
• Interactive 3D seat map with visual feedback and smooth animations
• Integrated payment gateways (Stripe & Razorpay) for secure transactions
• Smart OTT integration - automatically detects cinema vs streaming content
• Dynamic showtime generation with intelligent scheduling
• QR code ticket generation & PDF downloads
• Food & beverage ordering system
• Loyalty points & wishlist functionality
• Comprehensive review system with ratings

🚀 **Tech Stack:**
• Frontend: React 19, Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
• Backend: Node.js, PostgreSQL (Neon), Redis (Upstash)
• Authentication: NextAuth.js
• APIs: TMDb API for movie data, Stripe, Razorpay
• Performance: ISR caching, parallel API calls, optimized image loading

💡 **What I Learned:**
Building this project taught me a lot about real-time systems, payment integration, database optimization, and creating delightful user experiences. The challenge of preventing seat conflicts while maintaining performance was particularly interesting!
